# ExpenseTracker
A Python command-line Expense Tracker to log daily expenses, categorize spending, and compare against a monthly budget. It saves expenses in a CSV file, remembers the budget for the month, and provides summaries with totals, category breakdowns, remaining balance, and daily limitsâ€”making budgeting simple and effective from the terminal.
